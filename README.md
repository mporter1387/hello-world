Hey buddy,

You are new at this, and there WILL be times when you feel beaten, discouraged, helpless and hopeless. 

But you must persevere. 

You must commit and learn every single day.

Grind.

Set goals.

Attain goals.

Beat goals.

Do what has to be done. 

Not just for your family, but for yourself.
